## Introductory Information About MITRE Course

Cyber attackers have been performing cyber attacks on systems using the  attack vectors of the time since digital systems existed. In the past,  cyber attacks consisted of simple and understandable attack methods, as  there were no complex and large digital systems. But over time, digital  systems have grown and evolved into more complex digital structures, so  cyber attacks have also become more difficult to understand with  advanced methods. This also makes it difficult the detection of cyber  attacks. Today, in order to fully understand a cyber attack, it is  necessary to model the steps and details of cyber attacks in a way that  is suitable for certain groups. One of the important frameworks that  meet this modeling need is the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

SOC candidates will have a  thorough knowledge of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework at the end of the  training and are recommended to complete the topics in this training  without skipping any parts.
