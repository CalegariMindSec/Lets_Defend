## SOC Types and Roles

### What is a SOC?

A Security Operation Center (SOC) is a facility where the information security team continuously monitors and analyzes the security of an  organization. The primary purpose of the SOC team is to detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents using technology, people, and  processes.

### Types of SOC Models

Depending on your security needs and budget, there are several types of SOCs:

![img](https://app-ld-img.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/training/soc-models.png)

### In-house SOC

This team is formed when an organization builds its cybersecurity  team. Organizations considering an internal SOC should have a budget to  support its continuity.

### Virtual SOC

This type of SOC team does not have a permanent facility and often works remotely in various locations.

### Co-Managed SOC

The Co-Managed SOC consists of internal SOC staff working with an  external Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP). Coordination is key  in this type of model.

### Command SOC

This SOC team oversees smaller SOCs across a large region.  Organizations using this model include large telecommunications  providers and defense agencies.

## People, Process, and Technology

Building a successful SOC requires serious coordination. Most  importantly, there should be a strong relationship between people,  processes, and technology.

Simply put, we will discuss the people, processes, and technologies required for SOC.

### People

A strong SOC team requires highly trained personnel who are familiar  with security alerts and attack scenarios. Because attack types are  constantly changing, you need team members who can easily adapt to new  attack types and are willing to conduct research.

### Processes

To further develop your SOC structure, you need to align it with many different types of security requirements, such as NIST, PCI, and HIPAA. All processes require extreme standardization of actions to ensure  nothing is left out.

### Technology

The team needs to have different products for many tasks, such as  penetration testing, detection, prevention, and analysis, and they need  to follow the market and technology closely to find the best solution  for the organization. Sometimes the best product on the market may not  be the best product for your team. Remember to consider other factors  such as the organization's budget.

## SOC Roles

### SOC Analyst

This role can be categorized as Level 1, 2, and 3 according to the  SOC structure. A security analyst classifies the alert, looks for the  cause, and advises on remediation.

### Incident Responder

An Incident Response Officer is an individual responsible for threat  detection. This role performs the initial assessment of security  breaches.

### Threat Hunter

A Threat Hunter is a cybersecurity professional who proactively seeks out and investigates potential threats and vulnerabilities within an  organization's network or system. They use a combination of manual and  automated techniques to detect, isolate, and mitigate advanced  persistent threats (APTs) and other sophisticated attacks that may evade traditional security measures. Threat hunters typically have a deep  understanding of the organization's IT infrastructure and security  posture, as well as knowledge of emerging threats and attack tactics.  They aim to find and eliminate threats before they can damage or disrupt the business.

### Security Engineer

Security engineers are responsible for maintaining the security  infrastructure of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)  solutions and security operations center (SOC) products. For example, a  security engineer builds the connection between SIEM and Security  Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) products.

### SOC Manager

A SOC manager takes on management responsibilities such as budgeting, strategizing, managing staff, and coordinating operations. They deal  with operational rather than technical issues.

## SOC Analyst and Their Responsibilities

In this section, we will discuss what a SOC Analyst is, where they  fit into the SOC team, and the general responsibilities of the role. It  is important to review these sections carefully before learning about  the technical side of the role. In this way, aspiring SOC Analyst  candidates can get an idea of what their future career might look like.

A SOC Analyst is the first person to investigate threats to a system. If the situation demands it, they escalate incidents to their  supervisors so they can mitigate threats. The SOC Analyst plays an  important role on the SOC team because they are the first person to  respond to a threat.

### The Advantages of Being a SOC Analyst

There are many various techniques for attack vectors and malicious  software and they increase more and more every day. As an analyst you  will get greater enjoyment from investigating these varying types of  incidents. Even though the operating systems, security products, etc.  that you use will be the same the job will feel less monotonous because  you will be analyzing different incidents. Also, you may not encounter  such techniques (not every week or every day).

### A Day in the Life of a SOC Analyst

Throughout the day, a SOC analyst typically reviews alerts in the  SIEM and determines which ones are real threats. To reach a conclusion,  they use various security and protection products such as Endpoint  Detection and Response (EDR), Log Management, and SOAR. We will explain  in detail why and how these products are used later in the training  program.

To be a successful SOC analyst who is not dependent on security  products and can correctly analyze SIEM alerts, you must have the  following skills and abilities.

### Operating Systems

To determine what is abnormal in a system, you first need to know  what is accepted as normal. For example, there are many services within  the Windows operating system, and it is difficult to know which ones are suspicious without knowing which ones are or could be considered normal Windows services. Therefore, you should be familiar with how  Windows/Linux operating systems work.

### Network

First and foremost, in this role, you will be dealing with a lot of  malicious IPs and URLs, so you need to confirm that there are no devices on the network trying to connect to those addresses. Once you  accomplish that, it will set the direction of the analysis.

This step is a bit more complicated because you may have to find a  potential data leak on the network. To perform all of these functions,  you need to understand the basics of networking.

### Malware Analysis

When dealing with most threats, you are likely to encounter some type of malicious software. To understand the real purpose of these  malicious programs (they sometimes display different behaviors to fool  analysts), you need to have malware analysis skills.

It is important to at least determine what the command and control  center of the malicious file is and whether or not there is a device  communicating with that address.

In general, we have discussed what a SOC analyst is, what the  responsibilities of the role are, and what skills a SOC Analyst needs to have. As the course progresses, it will also cover technical areas,  starting with SIEM.

## SIEM and Analyst Relationship

This lesson discusses what SIEM is, why it is used in a SOC, and how SIEM relates to the SOC analyst.

### What is SIEM?

SIEM is a security solution that combines security information and  event management, which involves real-time logging of events in an  environment. The ultimate purpose of event logging is to detect security threats.

Overall, SIEM products have a lot of features. The ones that interest us most as SOC analysts are those that collect and filter data and  provide alerts for suspicious events.

Example alert: If someone on a Windows operating system tries to  enter 20 incorrect passwords in 10 seconds, this is suspicious activity. It is unlikely that someone who has forgotten their password would try  to re-enter it that many times in such a short period of time. So we  create a SIEM rule/filter to detect such activity that exceeds the  threshold. Based on this SIEM rule, an alert will be generated when such a situation occurs.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/siem/siem+alert.png)

Some popular SIEM solutions: IBM QRadar, ArcSight ESM, FortiSIEM,  Splunk, etc. To get a better picture, you can visit the “Monitoring”  page on LetsDefend.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/siem/siem-monitoring.PNG)

### Relationship Between a SOC Analyst and SIEM

Although SIEM solutions have many features, SOC analysts typically  only track alerts. There are other groups/people responsible for  developing configurations and rule correlations.

As mentioned above, alerts are generated from data that passes  through filters. Alerts are first analyzed by a SOC analyst. This is  where a SOC analyst's job in the security operations center begins. In  essence, they have to determine whether the generated alert is a real  threat or a false alert.

For a better understanding, let's go back to the "Monitoring" page;  as you can see below, there are various alerts on the SIEM interface. A  SOC analyst should analyze the details related to these alerts with the  help of other SOC products (such as EDR, Log Management, Threat  Intelligence Feed, etc.) and ultimately determine whether they are real  threats or not.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/siem/alert-details.PNG)

You can view newly created alerts in the "Main Channel" and think of  this channel as a shared channel. Your teammates are not visible in this simulation, but in a real work scenario, your teammates will be able to see this panel. After you select the alert you want to work on, click  the Take Ownership button in the Action area to take ownership of the  alert and direct it to the Investigation Channel. This way, your  teammates can see which alert you are actively working on. At the same  time, this will help them see which alerts you are already working on so they can select other alerts. This way, your team can quickly review  all alerts.

When you click on the alert, you can see the details of the alert.  This allows you to gather the information (hostname, IP address, file  hash information, etc.) required to investigate.

### Quick Tip

Note that from time to time, false alerts may be generated in the  SIEM. A good SOC analyst would be able to identify such situations and  provide feedback to the team, thereby contributing to the efficiency of  the SOC team.

### Example:

Let's say that an SIEM team has put together a rule set that  generates alerts for URL addresses that have the word "union" in them  and is trying to detect SQL injections.

A user did a search using  "https://www.google.com/search?q=sql+union+usage", and an alert was  created in the SIEM, it looks like there is no obvious threat. The alert was generated because the keyword "union" was included in the URL.  These types of anomalies can be shared with the SIEM team to optimize  the alerting process.

### Final Words

So far, we have covered what SIEM is, how it helps SOC analysts, and  how it should be used. Later in our course, we will discuss how to  analyze an alert created in the SIEM.

## Log Management

As a SOC Analyst, you will perform a lot of log analysis. For  this reason, it is important to be familiar with "Log Management"  systems/solutions. It doesn't matter what product you use, it's about  knowing what to look for and where to look for it.

The remainder of this lesson discusses how "Log Management" solutions can be used effectively by SOC analysts.

### What is Log Management?

As the name implies, Log Management provides access to all logs in an environment (web logs, OS logs, firewall, proxy, EDR, etc.) and allows  you to manage them in one place. This increases efficiency and saves  time.

If you can't access the logs from one place, then the same request  (e.g., the goal is to determine all users on letsdefend.io) would have  to be sent to different devices. This would increase your margin for  error and the amount of time you would need to spend.

If you go to the “Log Management” page in LetsDefend, you will see  various log sources such as Proxy, Exchange, and Firewall listed as  “Type”. This means that all these log sources have been collected in one place and log output from sources like Proxy, FW, etc. can be seen with just one query.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/log-management/log-management.PNG)

## Purpose of Log Management

SOC analysts typically rely on Log Management to determine if there  is any communication with a particular address and to view the details  of that communication. Let's say you came across a piece of malware and  after running it, you found that it was communicating with and executing commands from the "letsdefend.io" address. In this situation, the  command&control center is "letsdefend.io", you can search for  "letsdefend.io" in your company's log management to see if any devices  have attempted to communicate with the command&control center.

This leaves us with a second situation: You see a SIEM alert  indicating that a LetsDefendHost device on your network is leaking data  to IP address 122[.]194[.]229[.]59. You have conducted an investigation, isolated the device from the network, performed the necessary  processes, and now you are in control. But there's still something you  haven't addressed: are there any other devices sending data to the  suspicious IP address (122[.]194[.]229[.]59)? The alert may have only  included LetsDefendHost, but you should still search for the suspicious  address in Log Management to see if there is anything the system may not have detected and try to find any connections.

### Questions

1 - What source IP address entered the URL 'https://github.com/apache/flink/compare'?

> **Answer:** 172.16.17.54

2 - What is the type of log that has a destination port number of 52567 and a source IP address of 8.8.8.8?

> **Answer:** DNS

## EDR - Endpoint Detection and Response

A SOC analyst must spend a significant amount of time using EDR when  performing analysis on an endpoint device. The following sections  discuss why EDR is beneficial to SOC analysts and how to use it  effectively.

### What is EDR?

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), also known as Endpoint Threat  Detection and Response (ETDR), is an integrated endpoint security  solution that combines continuous, real-time monitoring and collection  of endpoint data with rules-based automated response and analysis  capabilities. (Definition source: mcafee.com)

### Analysis with EDR

Some EDR solutions commonly used in the workplace: CarbonBlack, SentinelOne, and FireEye HX.

To understand what you can do with EDR as an analyst, let's take a look at "Endpoint Security" on LetsDefend.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/edr/edr-letsdefend.PNG)

As you can see in the image, the accessible endpoint devices are  listed on the left. You can search for endpoints in the search bar, or  if there is an IOC (an IP address, file hash, process name, etc.), we  can perform a search across all hosts.

The right side displays general information about the device and  shows sections such as Browser History, Network Connections, and Process List.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/edr/edr-letsdefend.PNG)

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/edr/process-list.PNG)

### Live Investigation

Next, you can click the Connect button and access the machine itself to continue the analysis.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/edr/edr-connect.PNG)

### Containment

You need to isolate a hacked machine from the network. There are two  important reasons for doing this: to prevent the attacker from  connecting to the internal network and moving around the internal  network.

Therefore, the device should be isolated from the internal and  external networks until the vulnerabilities are repaired and the device  is ready for use. You can ensure isolation by using the containment  feature of EDR solutions. This feature allows the selected device to  communicate solely with the EDR center. This means that even though the  device is isolated from the network, you can continue your analysis.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/edr/containment.PNG)

### Quick Tip

If you have any type of IOC, such as a file hash, file name, etc.,  you can perform a search in EDR across all hosts and see if there is a  match. For example, let's say you are certain that a device has been  hacked and you have obtained a file with an MD5 hash of  "ac596d282e2f9b1501d66fce5a451f00". You can search for this hash value  in EDR and determine whether this file exists or is being executed on  other devices. This will help you understand who has been affected by  this attack.

### Conclusion

We covered the basics of EDR, which you will use just as often as Log Management. In the past, we have seen analysts fail to use EDR  solutions effectively, so spending some time on this topic will put you  one step ahead of the crowd.

### Questions

1 - What is the hostname of the device where the “nmap” file with a hash value of “83e0cfc95de1153d405e839e53d408f5” is executed?

> **Answer:** EricProd

2 - A "Ps1.hta" file was executed on a device with the hostname "Roberto". What is the complete CMD command?

> **Answer:** C:/Windows/System32/mshta.exe C:/Users/roberto/Desktop/Ps1.hta

## SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation and Response)

SOAR stands for Security Orchestration Automation and Response.  It enables security products and tools in an environment to work  together, streamlining the tasks of SOC team members. For example, it  will automatically search VirusTotal for the source IP of a SIEM alert,  reducing the workload of the SOC analyst.

Some SOAR products commonly used in the industry:

- Splunk Phantom
- IBM Resilient
- Logsign
- Demisto

The image below shows what can be achieved with a SOAR solution.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/SOAR/soar-capabilities.jpg)

image: hawk-eye.io

The benefits of SOAR and how you can effectively use SOAR as a SOC analyst will be the focus of the rest of this lesson.

## Saves You Time

SOAR saves time with workflows that automate processes. Some common workflows are:

- IP address reputation control
- Hash query
- Scanning an acquired file in a sandbox environment
- …

## Centralization (A single platform for everything you need)

It allows you to use different security tools in your environment  (sandbox, log management, 3rd party tools, etc.) by providing an  all-in-one software. These tools are integrated into the SOAR solution  and can be used on the same platform.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/SOAR/soar-central.PNG)

image: splunk.com

### Playbooks

You can easily investigate SIEM alerts using playbooks created for  different scenarios within SOAR. Even if you don't know or remember all the procedures, you can perform an analysis by following the steps outlined in the playbooks.

In addition, these playbooks help ensure that the entire SOC team is  on the same page when performing their analysis. For example, all team  members need to check IP reputation, so if one team member is not  checking it and the others are, this is an undesirable situation. We can avoid this situation by adding this step to the playbook.

### LetsDefend and SOAR

You can think of "Case Management" as the same as SOAR. On the SIEM  (monitoring) page, you can open tickets for the cases you created. When  you look at the page, the first thing you see is a list of open and  closed cases.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/SOAR/ticketing.PNG)

If you click on any open case, you will see an automatically assigned playbook. You can investigate the associated SIEM (monitoring) alert  following this playbook.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/SOAR/playbook-soar.PNG)

So far, we have covered what a SOAR solution is, how it is used in a  SOC environment, and how it benefits SOC analysts in general. In the  next lesson, we will explore threat intelligence and how it relates to a SOC analyst.

## Threat Intelligence Feed

A SOC team should be immediately aware of the latest threats and  take the necessary precautions. To meet this need, threat intelligence  feeds are created. As a SOC analyst, you can use these feeds to guide  your investigations.

A Threat Intelligence Feed is data (such as malware hashes, C2  (Command&Control) domain/IP addresses etc.) provided by a third  party company.

Looking at LetsDefend's Threat Intel page, you can see many types of data (hash, IP, etc.)

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/SOAR/TI.PNG)

The data here consists of artifacts from previous malicious activity. It could be the hash of malware or the IP address of a command and  control center. As a SOC analyst, you need to search threat intelligence feeds to determine if a hash file at hand has ever been used in a  malicious scenario in the past.

Here are some free and popular sources you can use:

- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)  
- [Talos Intelligence](https://talosintelligence.com/)  

**Important points to highlight:**

### **If data you run through feeds does not show up**

Let's say you ran a hash of an .exe in VirusTotal and in the past you didn't find anything suspicious about it. In this case, you should not  just assume that the file is clean, that would be a mistake. A SOC  analyst should carefully perform the necessary file analysis  (static/dynamic).

### **We shouldn’t forget that IP addresses can change hands.**

For example, let's say an attacker created a server on AWS (Amazon  Web Services) and used it as a command and control center. Then various  threat intelligence feeds listed that IP address as a malicious address.

2 months later, the attacker shut down the server and someone else  moved their personal blog to that server. This doesn't mean that people  who visited the blog were exposed to malicious content. The fact that  this IP address has been used for malicious purposes in the past does  not mean that it contains malicious content.

## Common Mistakes made by SOC Analysts

Like everyone else, SOC analysts can make mistakes. In this  section, we will discuss common mistakes made by SOC analysts and how to avoid making them yourself.

- Over-reliance on VirusTotal Results
- Hasty Analysis of Malware in a Sandbox
- Inadequate Log Analysis
- Overlooking VirusTotal Dates

It is recommended that you review this lesson after you have completed the previous lessons in this course.

### Over-reliance on VirusTotal Results

Sometimes we can rely on the result displayed on VirusTotal’s green  screen after analyzing a file’s URL and seeing that the address is  harmless. However, there is a new malicious software developed using an  AV (AntiVirus) bypass technique that may not be detected by VT  (VirusTotal). For this reason, we should accept VirusTotal as a  supporting tool and perform our analyses with this in mind.

Here’s a detailed blog post on the subject for further reading: [VirusTotal is not an Incident Responder](https://medium.com/maverislabs/virustotal-is-not-an-incident-responder-80a6bb687eb9)

### Hasty Analysis of Malware in a Sandbox

A 3-4 minute analysis in a sandbox environment may not always yield accurate results. Here are the reasons why:

Malware might be able to detect a sandbox environment and will not activate itself.

Malware may not become active for 10 to 15 minutes after the operation is performed.

For this reason, the duration of the analysis should be kept as long  as possible and it should take place in a real environment, if possible.

### Inadequate Log Analysis

Occasionally we see that some log analysis is not performed properly. For example, let's say that a piece of malware has been detected on a  machine with the hostname "LetsDefend", and that malware is secretly  sending data to the address "letsdefend.io". As a SOC analyst, you  should use Log Management solutions to determine if any other device is  also attempting to connect to this address.

### Overlooking VirusTotal Dates

If the search you performed in VirusTotal has already been queried, a result from the cache will be displayed. For example: We searched the  address "letsdefend.io" in VirusTotal and the result is shown below.

![img](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/SOC+Fundamentals/mistakes/vt-old.PNG)

An attacker could simply search a clean URL on VirusTotal and replace it with malicious content. This is why you should not just look at the  search cache, but conduct a new search.
