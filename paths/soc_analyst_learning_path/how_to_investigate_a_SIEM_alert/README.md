## Detection

  SIEM alerts are  notifications generated by the SIEM system based on predefined rules and correlation algorithms. These rules are typically customized to meet an organization's specific security requirements. When an event matches  the defined criteria, the SIEM system triggers an alert.

  In LetsDefend, alerts are prepared and continuously updated by cybersecurity experts. These  alerts cover a range of threats, from the most common attacks used by  adversaries to the most sophisticated zero-day exploits.

### Monitoring

This section introduces  you to the "Monitoring" page. Divided into three sections, the  Monitoring page acts as a dashboard for viewing generated alerts. These  sections are:

- ​    Main Channel  
- ​    Investigation Channel  
- ​    Closed Alerts  

![img](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/How+to+investigate+SIEM+alert/2.Detection/image2_1.png)

###   Main Channel

 The default view of the  Monitoring page displays all open incidents available for ownership.  Within the Main Channel, you'll find fields displaying key details about the triggered alerts, including:

- ​    **Severity**: Indicates the level of severity, categorized as Low, Medium, High, or Critical.  
- ​    **Date**: Displays the date of the incident. (UTC +0 Timezone)  
- ​    **Rule Name**: Identifies the specific rule triggered by the event.  
- ​    **EventID**: Provides a unique identifier for the event.  
- ​    **Type**: Specifies the type of event or alert triggered.  
- ​    **Action**: Assigns ownership of the alert to you for further investigation and analysis.

### Taking Ownership

Once you have decided which alert you want to investigate, click on it to access further details. The alert details provide  comprehensive insight into various aspects of the alert. Next, use the  'Take ownership' option in the top right-hand corner. This action will  assign the alert to you for further analysis and investigation.

![img](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/How+to+investigate+SIEM+alert/2.Detection/image2_4.gif)

Upon taking ownership of  the alert, it is automatically sent to the investigation channel, where  you can initiate the case to further analyze and respond to the security incident.

### Investigation Channel

The Investigation Channel is designed for managing and responding to active alerts. When an alert is assigned to you, it will appear in this channel. From here, you can  create a case to investigate the alert in more detail.

![img](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/How+to+investigate+SIEM+alert/2.Detection/image2_5.png)

When you create a case  for an alert, the 'Case Management' page opens immediately, allowing you to start the playbook. From the Case Management page, you can view the  details of the incident and start the Playbook, which is a pre-arranged  series of instructions that guide you through the processes of the  investigation.

![img](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/How+to+investigate+SIEM+alert/2.Detection/image2_6.png)

### Playbooks

There are many different  types of alerts (web attacks, ransomware, malware, phishing, etc.) in  the SOC (Security Operations Centre) environment. The methods and  approaches for investigating these alerts are different. Workflows for  effective and consistent analysis of alerts generated by SIEM or other  security tools are called playbooks.

For example, when you  click the 'Create Case' button for an alert on the LetsDefend monitoring page, a ticket is automatically created in the 'Case Management'. The  system will assign a specific playbook to it and provide you with the  necessary steps to properly investigate the alert by following the  instructions.

![img](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/How+to+investigate+SIEM+alert/2.Detection/image2_7.png)

### Why Are Playbooks Important?

  As SOC analysts, we don't always know the exact steps to take when dealing with alerts. Playbooks help by providing a clear, step-by-step process to follow during an  investigation. This is especially helpful for new analysts just starting their SOC careers.

### Closing the Alert

Once the playbook has  been completed and all inquiries have been dealt with, including the  analysis phase, we need to return to the Monitoring page within the  Investigation channel to officially close the alert.

The alert needs to be  analyzed to determine if it is a true positive or a false positive. A  true positive means that the alert is legitimate and requires further  action, whereas a false positive means that the alert is a false alarm.

![img](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/How+to+investigate+SIEM+alert/2.Detection/image2_8.png)

Once you've completed  your analysis, you should document your findings in the Analyst Note  section. The document should include your reasoning, relevant data or  observations, and steps taken during your investigation. It is critical  as it provides a record of your analysis and can be used for future  reference or in resolving similar alerts.

Once the alert is closed, you can review the details of your analysis in the Closed Alerts  section. Here you'll find the answers you provided to the Playbook  questions, confirming your accurate assessment of the situation.

![img](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/How+to+investigate+SIEM+alert/2.Detection/image2_9.png)

For further insight into  the investigation process and additional context around the alert, you  can also access the official incident report or community walkthrough.  These resources offer valuable information for understanding the threat  landscape and improving future response efforts.

In this lesson, we have  learned about SIEM alerts, how to filter them, how to take ownership,  and how to open an alert case from the Monitoring page.

In the next lesson, we will work together to resolve a SIEM alert.
